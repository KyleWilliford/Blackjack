build 4 (2/16/13):
+ Added explicit keyword to constructor definitions where necessary (Effective C++ practice)
+ Changed preprocessor macros to compiler const definitions in AppStart.cpp and Deck.cpp (Effective C++ practice)
+ Added const keyword where necessary (Effective C++ practice)
- Prevented user from entering a longer than intended string to get a new game/exit option (i.e. entering "NY" in the prompt would read as "N," and exit the program). 
This behavior now only checks the first element of the input string, and tells the user the string is invalid if they entered more than just 'y'/ 'n', etc.
- Removed unused variables and function prototypes.
+ Added loop to main menu to prevent exiting when invalid input is entered by the user.
- Moved many one-line and two-line function implementations to inline implementations inside of the respective header files
- Changed shuffle time limit to 1.0 second
+ Added indicator of how many card shuffle actions were performed within the shuffle time limit

build 3 (2/15/13):

+ Fixed second dealer card from being shown after the dealer stands, but the player has not. (bug)
- Modified UI spacing to make changes between rounds more noticeable
+ Added more descriptive comments to codebase
