This is a work in progress. This is not intended for commercial release.

Please do not use this code in any of your projects. Ask me for permission if you wish to contribute (I prefer ideas rather than code contributions, if any*).

I hereby reserve all rights as to the use and/or distribution of this code, which is under my sole ownership. Feel free to play the game though.

*The point of this project is to improve my programming skills through practice, and to create something fun while doing so. Allowing code contributions is counter-productive to this goal.
